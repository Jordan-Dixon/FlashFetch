FlashFetch is an alternative to [Neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch)
written in Rust with a focus on customization.

## Warning:
Flashfetch is not to a "Release" state yet. Right now, it's in a "beta" state with a lot of glitched and bugs. If you run into any problems, be sure to file an issue so that it can be fixed!

# To Do:
- Make a functioning neofetch clone
- Support for multiple distros
- Etc.
